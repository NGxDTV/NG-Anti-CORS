This plugin is especially useful for:

- Frontend developers working with APIs
- Testing web applications in local development environments
- Debugging CORS issues in production environments

## Troubleshooting 🔧

**Plugin not working?**

- Make sure the plugin is activated
- Check if CORS allowing is enabled for the current domain
- Completely reload the page (CTRL+F5)
- Check for errors in the developer tools (F12)
- Verify that the site is actually experiencing CORS issues that need to be bypassed

## Privacy and Security 🔒

**NG-Anti-CORS**:
- Collects **no** personal data
- Sends **no** information to remote servers
- Works completely locally in your browser
